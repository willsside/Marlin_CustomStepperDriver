# Marlin_CustomStepperDriver
Add a 5th stepper driver to the stock Creality 4.2.2 board! 

I use a fork of Jyer's Marlin. In this repo are my configuration.h and configuration_adv.h files along with the pins_CREALITY_V4.h file. The changes required in these files are described in the tutorial linked here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6iDR2msre3tUxXAF8RXY9PUIZHn8q9FAH5B1m9y7AY/edit?usp=sharing).
